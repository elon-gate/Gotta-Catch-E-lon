-------------------------------------And now, a small poem by an anonymous intelectual----------------------------------------
I am a snail, going through snail land
Just snailing around, slowly but surely.
One day I found a dog that almost stepped on me
But I was not mad, as I knew he didn't mean it.

Just as I was about to leave, mind my own business
The dog turns towards me and says:
"Bark!"
I don't know what I expected. An apology? A friendship?
Those things seem too human for a dog to say.

As the dog went away, I was starting to miss him
Even though I've only met him like an instant ago
I started feeling funny, and suddenly was on a cloud
And I realised one thing: the dog did step on me

But now I'm happy, thoughtful, as I know I've done my part
And am now up here, waiting, constantly waiting for you
